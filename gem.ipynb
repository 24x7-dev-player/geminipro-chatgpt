       "   text: \"A computer is an electronic device that can be programmed to carry out a set of instructions. The basic components of a computer are the processor, memory, storage, input devices, and output devices. The processor is the \\\"brain\\\" of the computer and controls all of the other components. Memory stores the instructions and data that the processor is currently working on. Storage stores data that is not currently being used by the processor. Input devices allow the user to enter data into the computer, such as a keyboard or mouse. Output devices allow the computer to display or print data, such as a monitor or printer.\\n\\nWhen you give a computer a command, the processor fetches the instructions for that command from memory. The processor then executes the instructions, which may involve reading or writing data from or to storage, or sending data to an output device.\\n\\nComputers are used for a wide variety of tasks, including word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, games, and web browsing. Computers can also be used to control other devices, such as robots and manufacturing equipment.\\n\\nHere is a simplified analogy that may help you understand how a computer works:\\n\\nImagine a computer as a chef. The processor is the chef, the memory is the chef\\'s cookbook, the storage is the pantry, the input devices are the customer\\'s orders, and the output devices are the plates of food.\\n\\nWhen a customer places an order, the chef (processor) looks up the recipe in the cookbook (memory). The chef then gathers the ingredients from the pantry (storage) and cooks the food (executes the instructions). Finally, the chef plates the food (sends the data to an output device) and serves it to the customer.\"\n",
